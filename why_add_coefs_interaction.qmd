## 

For $x_1$ denoting political ideology and $x_2$ representing the topic either relevant $(x_2=1)$ or irrelevant to the $(x_2=0)$ to the comment.

$$
y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2+ \epsilon
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} y &= \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2 \\
&=\begin{cases}
\beta_1 + \beta_3 & \text{if } x_2=1 \\
\beta_1 & \text{if } x_2=0
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the present case $\beta_1 < 0$, meaning that more conservative individuals perceive content as more toxic on average (across topics). We are interesting in when the interaction effect is "undoing" the main effect â€“ i.e. $\beta_1 + \beta_3 > 0$
