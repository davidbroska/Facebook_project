Both target_ideology.csv and target_like_ideology.csv contain user's ideology related to the 'target' comment (i.e., commenterB). 

1. target_ideology.csv contains information about the ideology of the user who wrote the target comment. Hence,

    a. user_id refers to the id of the author of the target comment
    b. ideology refers to the ideology of the author in the month in which the target comment was written

2. target_like_ideology.csv contains information about the ideology of the users who 'liked' the target comment. Hence,

    a. user_id refers to the id of users who 'liked' the target comment
    b. ideology refres to the ideology of the users who liked the target comment in the month when the comment was written

Note: Notice that user's ideology was measured monthly (using 3-month moving windows). Hence, the same user might be assigned a different ideology score if the comment was not written in the same month
